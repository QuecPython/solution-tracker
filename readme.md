### Functions

- Multi-technology positioning, geo-fence alarm, danger alarm, SOS alarm reporting, audio monitoring, recording, historical track playback, remote control, etc.
- Smart positioning
    - The system utilizes 4G communication/multi-technology positioning/distributed services to provide a one-stop solution from end to service for the smart tracker industry.
- All-platform support
    - The device operation platform and mobile APP have all-round functions, enabling terminal device manufacturers to quickly manage devices and end users without the need to build your own service platforms.
- Reliable and stable
    - The terminal device has high positioning accuracy, high sensitivity to danger perception, low power consumption, and stable operation. Terminal device manufacturers can develop customized solutions directly based on the public version, greatly shortening the hardware development cycle.

## Quectel Smart Tracker and Capabilities

### Capabilities

- **Support multiple platforms such as Alibaba IoT Platform, ThingsBoard, and private service platforms (Only Alibaba IoT Platform and ThingsBoard are supported currently, while others are under development)**
- **Support local and remote parameter configuration**
- **Support OTA upgrades**
- **Support offline data storage**
    - For unstable network connections, data that fails to be sent will be temporarily stored locally and prioritized for transmission to the server when the network is restored.
    - The amount of data stored offline can be configured through a configuration file.
- **Support common sensors and input devices**
    - Sensors
        - Ambient light sensor
        - Three-axis acceleration sensor
        - Temperature and humidity sensor
        - ...
    - Input devices
        - Microphone
        - ...
- **Support QuecPython, enabling rapid secondary development with Python**

### Supporting Component

### Advantages

- **Multi-technology Positioning**
    - Support multiple technologies such as GPS, BDS, GLONASS, Galileo, Wi-Fi and LBS to realize an accurate positioning in any corner of the world.
- **1000 mAh**
    - Ultra-low power consumption to realize ultra-long standby time (theoretical standby time longer than 8000 days).
- **Sensors**
    - Acceleration sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, and ambient light sensors greatly expand usage scenarios, including cold-chain transportation and logistics monitoring.
- **Wide-range Voltage Support**
    - Support voltage from 9 V to 108 V, covering cars, large trucks, new energy vehicles and electric scooters.
- **Fast Positioning**
    - Support fast positioning with the help of AGPS.
- **Concealed Installation**
    - Magnetic, adhesive, fixed, and movable. The hidden tracker provides effective positioning. 
- **Low-cost Development**
    - Secondary development with Python reduces software development costs.
